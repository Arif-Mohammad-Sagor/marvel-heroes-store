          What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where
          should we store them on the client-side ?
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Access Token: An access token is a credential that grants the client
          (such as a user's device or application) permission to access specific
          resources on a server. It is usually issued after successful
          authentication and is used to authenticate subsequent requests to
          protected endpoints. Access tokens have a limited lifespan and
          typically expire after a certain period.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Refresh Token: A refresh token is a credential that is used to obtain
          a new access token when the current one expires. It is usually
          longer-lived compared to access tokens and is used to refresh the
          access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. Refresh
          tokens are more sensitive and need to be stored securely.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Access Token: Access tokens are generally short-lived, so they can be
          stored in memory or a short-lived storage mechanism like a session
          cookie. This way, they can be easily accessed by the client to include
          them in subsequent API requests.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Refresh Token: Refresh tokens should be stored securely on the
          client-side to prevent unauthorized access. One common approach is to
          store them in an HTTP-only cookie, which helps mitigate cross-site
          scripting (XSS) attacks. Another option is to store them securely in a
          local storage mechanism with appropriate encryption and access
          controls.

          Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database systems, each with
          its own strengths and use cases. Here's a brief comparison between SQL
          and NoSQL databases:
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 font-bold text-lg">SQL Databases:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li className="my-3">
            Structure: SQL databases are based on a structured, tabular format
            with predefined schemas. They use SQL (Structured Query Language)
            for defining and manipulating data.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce strict data integrity rules,
            such as primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, ensuring data
            consistency and accuracy.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            ACID Transactions: SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity,
            Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which ensure
            reliable and consistent data operations.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they
            perform well when handling complex queries and large datasets. They
            are generally not as easily scalable horizontally across multiple
            servers.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="font-bold text-lg ">NoSQL Databases:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li className="my-3">
            Flexibility: NoSQL databases offer a flexible schema design,
            allowing for dynamic and unstructured data. They do not require a
            predefined schema, making them suitable for handling evolving or
            rapidly changing data.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Scalability: NoSQL databases excel at horizontal scalability,
            allowing them to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads
            across multiple servers or clusters.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Performance: NoSQL databases can offer high performance and low
            latency for specific use cases by optimizing for specific data
            models and distribution strategies.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Data Variety: NoSQL databases support various data models, including
            key-value, document, columnar, and graph databases, catering to
            different data structures a font-bold text-lgnd access patterns.

          What is express js? What is Nest JS ?
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It
          provides a simple and minimalist approach to building web servers and
          APIs. With Express.js, developers can easily handle HTTP requests,
          define routes, manage middleware, and render dynamic HTML pages.
        </p>
        <p className="my-3">
          NestJS, on the other hand, is a framework for building scalable and
          efficient server-side applications. It is built on top of Node.js and
          uses TypeScript as its primary language. NestJS follows the modular
          architecture pattern and provides a structured way to develop backend
          applications. It incorporates many design principles from Angular,
          making it familiar for developers coming from the Angular ecosystem.

          What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work
        </p>
        <p className='my-4 className="my-3"'>
          In MongoDB, the aggregate function is used to perform advanced
          operations on collections of documents. It works by using a series of
          steps called stages that process the data in a specific order.
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal">
          <li className="my-3">
            Input Stage: You start by specifying which documents to work with.
            You can filter the documents based on certain criteria, like
            matching specific values or conditions.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Transformation Stages: Next, you can modify the documents or extract
            specific information from them. For example, you can select only
            certain fields, calculate new values, or sort the documents based on
            a field.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Data Manipulation Stages: You can further modify the documents by
            adding new fields, removing existing fields, or changing their
            values. These stages allow you to shape the data to fit your needs.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Data Aggregation Stages: Here, you can perform more advanced
            operations like grouping documents together based on a common value,
            dividing them into groups (called buckets), or combining data from
            different collections.
          </li>
          <li className="my-3">
            Output Stage: Finally, you can specify how you want the results to
            be presented. You can choose to include or exclude certain fields,
            format the data, or store the results in a new collection
